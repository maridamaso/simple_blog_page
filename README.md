<h1 align="center">  ï ‚Ä¢·¥•‚Ä¢  î	Simple Blog Page </h1>
<p>I made this simple project which is a web page for a personal blog based on tumblr pages. I'm learning more and more about responsiveness and trying to apply it to my projects.</p>
<p>üå± With this project I intend to improve my skills in HTML and CSS languages.</p>

<h2>‡∏Ö’û‚Ä¢Ôªå‚Ä¢’û‡∏Ö Responsiveness</h2>
<p>I used responsiveness for the web page to work on mobile devices and computers. I'm starting to use responsiveness now so it still doesn't work 100%.</p>
